# DatasetForAeroCPNet
We present the first meteorological collaborative percep- tion dataset tailored to simulate real-world flight condi- tions, including radar shadowing and distance attenua- tion effects. This dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating collaborative perception systems in aviation.
